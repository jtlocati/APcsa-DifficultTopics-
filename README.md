# APcsa-

For any AP computer science applications (csa) students who find some topics or algorithms difficult. Feel free to study this code and reach out for any questions!!! :) 

This code is provides little to no usefull controbutions towards projects or advanced algorithms. 

**DO NOT USE** on APcsa class related projects, doing so may result in consequences decided by your teacher (if you dont get caught then i dont care if you use my code).
# How to use-

This code does not provide many practical uses towards the development of projects, it is meant to be studyed to gain a better understanding of Syantax and logic that appears within the APcsa course.

I reccomend downloading the GitHub mobile app to study on the go.
# Prior to Unit Four-
***Unit One-***
The biggest topic held within unit one is the baisic data types, varible calling, and other hello world esqe stuff.
***Unit Two-***
Unit two foucuses on methods, how to identify them, how to make them, and how to call them.
***Unit three-***
If-Else things
***Unit Four***
For/ While loops
For loops are best used when the number of iterations is known in advance.
While loops are better when the number of iterations depends on a condition, such as waiting for user input or processing data until a specific state is reached.
***Unit five***
